    💧 Irrigation: Meaning, Types, & Importance
  </h1>

  <p>
    Irrigation is the artificial and controlled application of water to soil or crops to meet their water needs.
    It helps maintain optimal moisture levels for plant growth, especially when rainfall is insufficient or unpredictable.
    Effective irrigation ensures proper water distribution, boosts crop productivity, and maintains soil fertility.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Irrigation</h2>

  <h3>Surface Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221228180719/Surface-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Surface Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
    In surface irrigation water is applied directly to the soil surface and allowed to flow over the field by gravity.
      This irrigation is done manually, with no involvement of any machine. It's one of the oldest and simplest methods of irrigation.
  </p>

  <h3>Localized Irrigation</h3>

  <p>
   It is also known as Micro Irrigation. Localized irrigation systems apply water directly to the root area of individual plants, reducing water loss from the soil through evaporation. It reduces water wastage, reduces evaporation, and weed growth. The network of pipes provides water evenly to the plants under low pressure.
      Drip irrigation, porous clay pots, porous pipes, and perforated plastic sleeves are examples of localized irrigation methods. It is a very efficient method because it provides the optimum amount of water to the plants or crops at regular intervals of time.
  </p>

  <h3>Sprinkler Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221212152538/Sprinkler-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Sprinkler Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
    With the help of a pump, a sprinkler irrigation system apply water under high pressure. It uses a small diameter nozzle in the pipes and distributes it in the form of small water droplets that resembles rain.
      Due to the wide range of discharge capacity, water is spread through a system of pipes, sprayed into the air, and irrigate the area. This method is commonly used in agriculture, landscaping, and sports field maintenance.
  </p>

  <h3>Drip Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221212152622/Drip-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Drip Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
   Drip irrigation is the most effective technique for providing water and nutrients to crops with less amount of water loss. This method involves the controlled release of water through a network of pipes, tubes, and emitters placed near or within the soil.
      It provides water and nutrients directly to the root area of the plant in precise amount and at specific time, ensuring that each plant receives exactly what it requires, when it requires it, for optimal growth.
  </p>

  <h3>Center-Pivot Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221228180512/Center-Pivot-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Center Pivot Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
   Center-pivot irrigation, also known as water-wheel or circle irrigation, is a mechanized method of irrigating large agricultural fields in a circular pattern. It uses a rotating system of pipes and sprinklers mounted on wheeled towers, with a central pivot point that delivers water to crops as the equipment moves in a circular path around the pivot point.
      It allows for precise control of water application based on factors like crop needs and weather conditions and requires less manual labor compared to traditional irrigation methods.
  </p>

  <h3>Sub-Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221228180602/Sub-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Sub Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
    Sub-irrigation also known as subsurface irrigation or seepage irrigation. In this method water is provided to plants by delivering it directly to the root area from below the soil surface.
      It uses capillary action to allow controlled movement of water. The water is directly absorbed through the roots.
  </p>

  <h3>Manual Irrigation</h3>
  <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221228180641/Manual-Irrigation.jpg" alt="Manual Irrigation" class="irrigation-img">
  <p>
   As the name suggests it can be done by anyone who is physically capable. Manual irrigation is by far the most common kind of irrigation. The farmer circulates water from the plant to the plant with manual irrigation.
      This requires a lot of effort and time, and it's usually done with a hose or bucket. It is suitable for small areas.
